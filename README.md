# WildGuard Animal Classification Model
---
## Overview
WildGuard is a deep learning model that classifies animal species as ENDANGERED or NON-ENDANGERED based on their images. This project aims to assist conservation efforts by automatically identifying endangered species from camera traps or user-submitted photos.

#### Bulk Dataset (1000+ Images)

## Usage (Instructions)
#### 1. Prediction
```
To predict whether an animal is endangered or not:

1. Open the WildGuard app on your mobile device
2. Upload or capture an image of an animal
3. Click the "Predict" button
4. The model will analyze the image and display the prediction as either:
   - ENDANGERED
   - NON-ENDANGERED
 ```
#### 2. Retraining the Model
```
Users can improve the model by retraining it with new data:

1. Navigate to the "Retrain" icon at the bottom of the WildGuard app
2. Prepare a zip file containing:
   - Two folders named "Endangered" and "Non-Endangered"
   - Each folder should contain images of the respective animal class
3. Upload the zip file through the app interface
4. Select training parameters:
   - Batch size
   - Number of epochs
5. Click "Retrain" to begin the retraining process
6. Once completed, the app will save the retrained model automatically
```
#### 3. Visualization
```
After retraining the model:

1. Navigate to the "Visualization" page in the app
2. View live training metrics and performance visualizations, including:
   - Accuracy graphs
   - Loss curves
   - Confusion matrices
3. The visualizations help understand the model's performance and improvement
```
